- What is pen testing?
    To validate and verify the effectiveness of application security controls. 
    Black box or grey box
    When vulnerability is found, propose mitigation to the owner of the application

- How should a pen test be started?
    Information gathering about the product
        Map the web app (fingerprint)
        Search engine discovery
        Fingerprint the web server
        Identify app entry points

    Then you can move on to common vulnerability testing.
        - Like what?
            Configuration
            Identity management
            Authentication
            Authorization
            Session management
            Input validation
            Error handling
            Cryptography
            Business logic
            Client side testing

- What are the pen test phases recommended by OWASP?
    Pre-engagement interactions
        Scoping
        Documentation
    Intelligence gathering
    Threat modeling
    Vulnerability analysis
    Exploitation
    Post exploitation
    Reporting

- What is the difference between reconnaissance and mapping?
    reconnaissance: gather as much information as you can (google search, etc.)
    mapping: figure out the mapping of the application (pages, resources, etc.)

- What makes the fingerprinting process so important?
    It is not only to find known vulnerabilities in unpatched versions but also specific misconfigurations in the framework and known file structure

- What should be done after the reconnaissance and mapping process, but before doing the actual pen tests?
    Identify entry points

    It identifies the attack surface, identifies likely areas of weakness
