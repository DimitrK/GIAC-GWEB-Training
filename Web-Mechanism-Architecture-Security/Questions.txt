- What is a load balancer system?
	Will balance a given TCP/IP port to multiple servers based on different algorithms (ex: round-robin, web server load, number of requests, etc.).

	- How can an attacker detect this system during the mapping process?
		By sending and examining multiple requests
		Based on the Date header if the server clocks are not synchronized
		In some cases, new information in the headers can be found, or new cookies (ex: Nortel's Alteon WebSystems load balancer)
