Web mechanisms architecture

- What is a load balancer system?
    Will balance a given TCP/IP port to multiple servers based on different algorithms (ex: round-robin, web server load, number of requests, etc.).

    - How can an attacker detect this system during the mapping process?
        By sending and examining multiple requests
        Based on the Date header if the server clocks are not synchronized
        In some cases, new information in the headers can be found, or new cookies (ex: Nortel's Alteon WebSystems load balancer)

- What is a CGI?
    Common Gateway Interface
    Instead of asking for a page, a browser can ask the server to run some script and send back the result
    Example:
        Page request: example.com/index.html
        CGI request example.com/cgi-bin/print.pl

    - Is it possible for the browser to send information to the script?
        Yes, via the URL or a POST request

    - Some security concerns?
        Only treat all executable files within the cgi directory (cgi-bin, usually) as CGI scripts

    - Is it used nowadays?
        No
        Hotmail was based on that

- What is a reverse proxy?
    A type of proxy server that retreives resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. The resources are returned as if they came from the proxy itself

    - How can it be used security wise?
        Can hide the existence and characteristics of an origin server
        Application firewalls can protect against DOS and DDOS, but removing malware or initiating takedowns can be more difficult without reverse proxies

- How can an attacker detect the presence of a firewall?
    Network scans (are network ports of the webserver being filtered in the network edge (no answer (or ICMP unreachable) or server is directly connected to the internet (returns RST packets for all non-listening ports))

- How can an attacker detect a reverse proxy?
    Ask for a page that you know will return a 404, inspect the answer. Ask for the same page but include an attack pattern, inspect the answer. If there is a difference, there is good chance that there is a proxy server acting as an attack filter.
        But can also be an application-level firewall

    If available HTTP methods return an error (ie. not supported) then there is something in between blocking them

    Timing requests

    Headers

- Is the TRACE http verb harmless?
    No, it can be used to mount a cross site tracing attack (XST)

    - What is XST?
        An XSS and a TRACE method attack
        Can be used to steal user's cookies via XSS even if the cookie has the HttpOnly flag

        - How is it exploited?
            If the attacker instructs a browser to issue a TRACE request to the webserver, and this browser has cookies for that domain, the cookies will be automatically included in the request headers and will be echoed back in the resulting response (in the BODY of the response), at this point then, the cookies will be accessible via JS even if the HttpOnly flag is up

    - Do modern browsers prevent TRACE requests made via JS?
        Yes, but you can still do it in Java for example

- What is the difference between a WAF and a firewall?
    The WAF is between the client and the server, the firewall is between the server and the DB

- Why is a distributed system less secure than a system contained in only one system?
    Because hardware/software communication is less reliable than direct code invocation and shared memory

- What concerns should be took into account by devloppers related to distributed systems?
    Unpredictable latency of remote access
    Concurrency
    Possibility of partial failures

- What is the difference between delegation and impersonnation?
    In a distributed environment, a server might need to call another server to complete some work. It can either identify to it as itself or as the orginating user.
    Delegation: identity and privileges of each intermediary are kept and can be used for access control
    Impersonnation: only the originator's identity and privileges are carried in the extended privilege attribute certificate

- In a distributed environment, is access control handled by the OS?
    Not nescessarly, it can be handled by the routers and application software.

- What authentication concerns must be addressed in a distributed environment?
    Eavesdropping
    Multiple passwords management: Does every system keep a copy of the user ID and password? Every DB storing authentication information is a target. Do we need to present the password everytime we want to accomplish something?
    Replay: Someone could copy authentication information while it is transmitted on the network (even if encrypted) and replay it later
    Trust: Should authentication be unilateral or should the user be able to verify and have confidence that the service being used is legitimate as well?

    - What is a common solution to these concerns?
        Use a certificate management system.

        - What is a certificate?
            A computer generated, frequently time-valid authenticated packet of information used in distributed systems to allow easy access to the various resources.
            - How do you implement the time-valid feature?
                With a time stamp or with a nonce (a random value unique to each communication)

            X509 is a list of certificates from a trusted certificate authority

            Certificate lists are based on public-key cryptography
                The certificates are signed by the issuers (encrypted with the issuer's private key) to bind the certificate holder's name with the issuer's public-key

- What is a centralized certificate distribution center?
    Instated of using a CA, the distributed system rely on a centralized certificate distribution center relies on one site to manage all of the certificates. It becomes a critical element in the distributed system. If it crashes or is compromised, the entire system suffers. The site contains a copy of the private keys of all valid users and services of the system in the certificate database manager.

- In a distributed systems, access control is generally done by what?
    A firewall.

    - What are the two categories of firewalls?
        Packet-filtering gateways
            Generally implemented on the router that connects the internal system to the outside world. A security engineer must explicitly state what may pass through the wall. This includes information that may go out of the firewall as well as what outside locations are allowed through the wall
        Proxy services
            Represent an internal client's service to the outside world.

- What are the most important issues that an internet service provider (ISP) can face?
    DoS and DDoS
    Excessive traffic and resource depletion caused by infected machine
    Attacking border gateway protocol routing  (redirects the traffic to obtain "interesting" traffic)
    Domain name system (DNS) information can be used to redirect internet traffic to serve the attacker
    Device compromise: get into the infrastructure and modify the configuration

- What can ISP do for their customers?
    Block incoming connections on some well-known ports (ex: 139, the classic port for Windows file sharing)
    Block spam, virus and other malware sent over mail
    "Block" some sites by removing the DNS mapping (can still access them, but the ISP DNS server will not resolve the names)
    Block outgoing connections to random external sites over port 25
        So that the user does not send spam if it becomes infected by a bot

    To maintain its service:
        Firewalls
        Intrusion detection
        Redundancy

- What is a problem of stoping a brute force attack by blocking the IP address?
    Could block a large group of users by blocking a proxy server used by an ISP or a large compagny

- If you are an ISP or DNS registrar, what can you do to help reduce scam?
    Make the registrant wait 24h for access to their domain. Often scammers will register and dump the domain within the first 24 hours as the scam is found out

- What is a load balancer?
    Act as a reverse proxy (user -> www.example.com (load balance to one or more server, user receives response as if it came directly from example.com) )
    Balance the work load over multiple servers / machine

    - How can it protects against DDoS?
        By using a SYN cookie, to protect against SYN flood attacks

    - How can it be used to reduce the amount of data transfered?
        HTTP compression

- How is HTTP compression established between the client and the server?
    Client send the Accept-Encoding header with the compression schemes it supports (ex: gzip, deflate)
    If server supports at least one of them, server may send data compressed and specify the scheme used with the header Content-Encoding (ex: gzip)

- What is the BREACH/CRIME exploit?
    Exploit of HTTP compression that can lead to token disclosure and more.

    - How do you mitigate against it?
        Disable HTTP compression (disabling TLS compression is not enough, since a chosen-plaintext attack against an HTTP payload can still be done)
            Performance cost
        Use CSRF protection

- Explain the Cache-Control header.
    no-store: if the response is not reusable
    no-cache: if it needs to be revalidated each time (do I have to most uptodate version)
    private: if it should not be cached by intermediate caches, public otherwise
    max-age: lifetime of the cache
