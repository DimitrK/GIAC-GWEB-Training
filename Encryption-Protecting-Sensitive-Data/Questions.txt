    An attacker forging domain name server records (DNS spoofing)
    Capturing passwords and other data by intermediate hosts (MitM)
    Exploitation of data by the people who control the intermediate hosts

- What is Public Key Infrastructure? (PKI)
    A security architecture to increase confidentiality of information exchanged over the insecure internet.
    PKI helps to bind public keys with corresponding user identities by means of a certificate authority (CA)
    Cryptographic keys can be delivered securely between users by PKI
    Uses a pair of public and private key to assure secure communication over the internet

    Ensure that you connect to the right person with the public key

- What are the components of PKI?
    A certificate authority that issues and verifies digital certificates
    A certificate management system for generation, distribution, storage and verification of certificates
    One or more directories where the certificates (with their public keys) are held
    A registration authority (RA) that acts as the verifier for the certificate authority

- How does PKI works?
    Sender and receiver agree upon a secret communication using public key encryption with digital signature

    The correspondence between a public and private key is taken care by the CA (based on the public key, CA determines the owner of the respective private key)

    Initially, the user requests the CA for biding his or her public key, the CA signs it and issues a public key certificate to the user.

    It binds the user's identity with the user public key.

    Coomunication can now take place with public key cryptography

- What is the job of Registration authority? (RA)
    Verify the identity of the user requesting the certificate

    - How is the digital signature generated?
        Generally, the entire document is used in a hash function with the private key as the seed
    The public key is used by a relying party to verify the digital signature
        - How does the verifier do that?
            Checks if the digital signature is created with the related private key.
            If the hash result is the same as the original hash result, which was converted into a digital signature during the signing process
        - How is it done with symmetric encryption?
            The receiver re-hash the message with the private key and compares the resulting hash with the digital signature
    A hash function is used to create and verify the digital signature
        Creates a digital representation of a message (a fingerprint - the hash value)
    - What is the role of the CA here?
        Signs the certificate to assure the authenticity of the public key and the subscriber identity. 

- What is the main function of a certificate?
    To bind a pair of public and privates keys to a particular subscriber
    The public key will be used to verify that the private key was used to create the related digital signature

- What is the main motive behind SSL?
    Provide privacy between two applications, like a client and a server.

    The protocal is designed to authenticate the server and the client

    Act as an arbitrator between the encryption algorithm and session key, also verifies the destination server before the transmission and reception of data.

- What are the basic properties of the secure channel provided by SSL?
    Has a private channel, where the messages are encrypted after the handshake that defines the secret key
    The channel is authenticated.
        The server end-points are always authenticated
        The client end-points are optionally authenticated
        The channel is reliable, the transmission has an integrity check

- What are the elements included in a session state?
    Session Identifier
        - What is it?
            A random sequence of bytes transmitted by the server to identify an active session state

            Compression method (the algorithm used to compress data prior to encryption)
            Cipher spec (Defines cryptographic attributes like the size of the hash)
            Master secret (secret shared between the client and the server)
            IsResumable (A flag specifies if a new session can be started)
        - What are the elements of the connection state?
            Server write key - The cypher key for data encrypted by the server and decrypted by the client
            Client write key - The cypher key for data encrypted by the client and decrypted by the server

 - How does the SSL Handshake protocol flow works?
    Client sends an hello message and the server must respond with another hello message

    After the connection is established, server sends a certificate to the client for authentication

    Ther server sends a hello done message, to inform that the handshake is completed and waits for client response

    The client answer with a certificate message or a no certificate alert
        If the certificate sent by the client has singing ability, a digitally signed certificate verifies the message

    The client transmit the changed cipher spec message, the client sends a message to initiate the completion of the message under the new algorithm, keys, and secrets

    The server replies by sending its own changed cypher spec message, initiates the completion of the message under the new cipher spec.

    The server starts to exchange the applicaiton layer data

 - What is TLS?
    Like SSL
    Encrypts connection segments at the application layer for the transport layer

    Uses asymmetric crypto for key exchange, symmetric crypto for confidentiallity, message authentication codes for message integrity

    The attacker gets the cyphertext simply by sniffing the traffic of the user.
    The goal is to find the key used for encryption.

- What is chosen-plaintext attack?
    The attacker defines his own plain text, feeds it to the cypher and analyzes the resulting ciphertext.

- What is known-plain text attack?
    The attacker has access to the ciphertext and the corresponding message, it is then possible to extract the cryptogrphic key.
        (This attack has been used to break enigma, you know that message starts or ends with a subset or one one particular sentence / set of words. You have the plain text and the ciphertext)
        You brute force the key, or reverse engineer it

- What is timing attack?
    The attacker tries to compromise the cryptosystem by analyzing the time taken to execute cryptographic algorithms

 - What are the methodologies to break an encryption algorithm? Describe them.
    Brute-force
        Guess the key
    Frequency analysis
        Ex: e is the most used letter in english, if there is a lot of k in the message, then maybe k=e
    Trickery and deceit
        The value of the data must be bellow the cost to break the algorithm
    One-time pad
        Algorithm considered to be unbreakable even after infinite resources are provided
        The key is as long as the message, so impossible to send very long messages

- What are the recommended symmetric cipher algorithms?
    AES, 3-key tripple DES, Salsa20

- What is hybrid cryptography and what cryptosystem use it?
    Uses both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, since symmetric is way faster.
    For example, a random symmetric session key is generated and encoded using asymmetric cipher and the recipient's private key. It is sent, and then communication is done symmetricly for the duration of the session.
    TLS use this scheme.

- In what situation asymmetric crypo is discouraged?
    When the data is higly structured / regular
    Ex: social security numbers are encoded with RSA and stored in DB. The attacker gain access to DB. He simply list all possible value of a security number, encode it with the public key and compre the results with the data in the DB. In this case symmetric ciphers should be used (or hashes if applicable).

    Unique string to ensure data integryti and prove authenticity, associates input message with an originating entity.

- Should you use authenticated encryption?
    Yes, especially if there is a chance that an adversary may have a chance to alter or provide the IV or cyphertext that you are attempting to decrypt.
        It provides confidentiallity, integrity and authenticity of the data.

- Should you use padding when in block mode?
    Yes
    PKCS5 for symmetric
    OAEP for asymmetric

            Transparent
        - Disavantages?
            Need to create multiple view for each usecase since when a client can have access to any encrypt data
            It uses deterministic encryption (the encrypted value of some data will always be the same)
            The sensitive data is sent to the DB in plaintext
    The application handles it
        - Advantages?
            Sensitive data sent encrypted
        - Disavantages?
            Most costly solutions
            Developpers need to understand crypto

    A proxy between the DB and the application handles it

- When should you rotate your keys?
    Compromised
    Compliance issues
    Used too many times

- What should happen to the old key?
    Archive it
        Until all dat athat was encrypted by the old key is now encoded with the new one
        Indefinetly (disaster recovery event)
    Revocation and destructions
        Public key certificates can be revoked with Certification Revocation Lists, prevents other entity to use it for encryption or authentication

- When is the CA used?
    For asymmetric key, the key pair is certified by the CA to bind the key pair to some entity and convey that it is trustworthy.

- What is a easy way to communicate a private key for symmetric encryption?
    Use a asymmetric encryption to communicate the private key.

- What is DES?
    Data encryption standard

    - DES uses a 64-bit key, but some bits are used for error detection, how many?
        8, so there are effectively 56 bits for security purposes

    - How many phases is there in DES?
        3: initial permutation (based on a table), data shifting (based on the key), reverse permutation (based on a table)
        The tables are known and the same for everyone

    - What is Tripple DES?
        It uses three 64 bits keys. The data is sent through the 3 phases of DES with the first key to produce the first result, the first result is sent as input to the second DES pass with the second key and so on.

- What is X.509?
    A public key listing service, to make a public key available

 - How does RSA works?
    The originator uses its private key to encrypt either the entire data file or its signature to the file by using a digest function.
        - The primary benifit of using a private key here?
            There are no key distribution problems
        - What does this method assume?
            That you can trust the source that publishes the public key
    The recepient then uses the public key to decrypt the signature. (Only the proper public key will decrypt the message)

    - On the other end, if you send a message to someone with a known public key, and that only him can read it?
        Encrypt the message with the recipient's public key so that only the recipient can verify the contents by utilizing his own private-key

    - What is One-way authentication?
        Protects the integrity and originality of a message. Only the destination is authenticating.

    - What is Two-way authentication?
        One-way authentication, but the destination sends a reply to the originator. The reply contains a new timestamp, the original nonce and a new nonce. The reply is signed with the originator's public key. The original nonce must be valid or the message is not authentic. 

    - What is Three-way authentication?
        Used when destination and originator do not have synchronized clocks or do not whish to trust clocks. After the two-way authentication takes place, the originator then sends a reply to a the reply of the destination including that new nonce contained in the original reply. After verifying matching nonce values, there is no need to verify timestamps

- There are multiple classes of certificates, what is the lowest and hightest?
    Lowest:  class 1, the identity was verified by the subject providing an email address and the authority sending a reply to this email address
    Highest: class 4, physical presentation of the subject and the CA must perform a background check.

- SSL consist of three phases, the first one is the authentication handshakes, what are the tasks accomplished during this phase?
    Established the protocol the 2 will employ to communicate
    Define the encryption algorithm

        Data transmission (communication). Data is transmitted in an encrypted manner. In addition, each block of data is digitally signed employing DES.

    - What is the final phase?
        A handshake to ensure both are aware the connection is closing, then closing it.
